# **Project for course GEO419 at FSU Jena**

### This tool aims to make detecting breakpoints and anomalies in Sentinel-1 time series easier:

* Importing raster data from Sentinel-1 satellite missions
* applying different functions along time axis of data to retrieve different metrics on a time scale
* giving user choice, which functions should be applied or used (planned)
* creating new raster files to visualize applied functions
